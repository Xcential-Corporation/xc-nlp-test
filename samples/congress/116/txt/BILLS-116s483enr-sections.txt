EPA often seeks										technical advice			 from the Scientific Advisory Panel on risks										that pesticides			 pose to wildlife, farm workers, pesticide										applicators,			 non-target species, as well as insect										resistance, and			 novel scientific issues surrounding new										technologies. The			 scientists of the SAP neither make nor										recommend policy			 decisions. They provide advice on the										science used to			 make these decisions. Their advice is										invaluable to the			 EPA as it strives to protect humans and										the environment			 from risks posed by pesticides. Due to the										time it takes to			 schedule and prepare for meetings with the										SAP, additional			 time and costs are needed.(6) Registered PIPs										stacked through			 conventional breeding.(7) Deployment of a										registered PIP with			 a different IRM plan (e.g., seed										blend).(8) The negotiated										acreage cap will			 depend upon EPA's determination of the										potential			 environmental exposure, risk(s) to non-target										organisms, and the			 risk of targeted pest developing										resistance to the			 pesticidal substance. The uncertainty of										these risks may			 reduce the allowable acreage, based upon the										quantity and type			 of non-target organism data submitted and										the lack of insect			 resistance management data, which is										usually not			 required for seed-increase registrations.										Registrants are			 encouraged to consult with EPA prior to										submission of a			 registration application in this										category.(9) Application can be										submitted prior to			 or concurrently with an application for										commercial			 registration.(10) For example, IRM										plan modifications			 that are applicant-initiated.(11) EPA-initiated										amendments shall			 not be charged fees.(12) Where the action										involves approval			 of a new or amended label, on or before										the end date of the			 decision review time, the Agency shall										provide to the			 applicant a draft accepted label, including										any changes made by			 the Agency that differ from the										applicant-submitted			 label and relevant supporting data										reviewed by the			 Agency.

The			 decision review times for the associated										actions run			 concurrently, but will end at the date of the										latest review time.(5) Any other covered										application that is			 associated with and dependent on the SAP										review will be			 subject to its separate registration service										fee. The decision			 review time for the associated action will										be extended by the			 decision review time for the SAP										review.(6) An application for										a new end-use			 product using a source of active ingredient										that (a) is not yet			 registered but (b) has an application										pending with the			 Agency for review, will be considered an										application for a			 new product with an unregistered source of										active ingredient.(7) Where the action										involves approval			 of a new or amended label, on or before										the end date of the			 decision review time, the Agency shall										provide to the			 applicant a draft accepted label, including										any changes made by			 the Agency that differ from the										applicant-submitted			 label and relevant supporting data										reviewed by the			 Agency. The applicant will notify the Agency										that the applicant			 either (a) agrees to all of the terms										associated with the			 draft accepted label as amended by the										Agency and requests			 that it be issued as the accepted final										Agency-stamped			 label; or (b) does not agree to one or more										of the terms of the			 draft accepted label as amended by the										Agency and requests			 additional time to resolve the										difference(s); or			 (c) withdraws the application without										prejudice for			 subsequent resubmission, but forfeits the										associated			 registration service fee. For cases described in										(b), the applicant			 shall have up to 30 calendar days to										reach agreement			 with the Agency on the final terms of the										Agency-accepted			 label. If the applicant agrees to all of the										terms of the			 accepted label as in (a), including upon										resolution of			 differences in (b), the Agency shall provide										an accepted final			 Agency-stamped label to the registrant										within 2 business			 days following the registrant’s written or										electronic			 confirmation of agreement to the Agency.(8) Due to low fee and										short time frame			 this category is not eligible for small										business waivers.			 Gold seal applies to one registered										product.(9) This category										includes amendments			 the sole purpose of which is to add DfE										(or equivalent			 terms that do not use “safe” or derivatives										of “safe”) logos to			 a label. DfE is a voluntary program. A										label bearing a DfE			 logo is not considered an Agency										endorsement because			 the ingredients in the qualifying										product must meet			 objective, scientific criteria established										and widely			 publicized by EPA.”..
