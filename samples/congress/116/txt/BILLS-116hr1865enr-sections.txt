Sec. 163. Concerns over PDVSA transactions with Rosneft.(a) Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:(1) In late 2016, Venezuelan state-owned oil company Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (referred to in this section as “PDVSA”), through a no compete transaction, secured a loan from Russian government-controlled oil company Rosneft, using 49.9 percent of PDVSA’s American subsidiary, CITGO Petroleum Corporation, including its assets in the United States, as collateral. As a result of this transaction, 100 percent of CITGO is held as collateral by PDVSA’s creditors.(2) CITGO, a wholly owned subsidiary of PDVSA, is engaged in interstate commerce and owns and controls critical energy infrastructure in 19 States of the United States, including an extensive network of pipelines, 48 terminals, and 3 refineries, with a combined oil refining capacity of 749,000 barrels per day. CITGO’s refinery in Lake Charles, Louisiana, is the sixth largest refinery in the United States.(3) The Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on Rosneft, which is controlled by the Government of the Russian Federation, and its Executive Chairman, Igor Sechin, following Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine and its illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014.(4) The Department of Homeland Security has designated the energy sector as critical to United States infrastructure.(5) The growing economic crisis in Venezuela raises the probability that the Maduro regime and PDVSA will default on their international debt obligations, resulting in a scenario in which Rosneft could come into control of CITGO’s United States energy infrastructure holdings.(b) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that—(1) control of critical United States energy infrastructure by Rosneft, a Russian government-controlled entity currently under United States sanctions that is led by Igor Sechin, who is also under United States sanctions and is a close associate of Vladimir Putin, would pose a significant risk to United States national security and energy security; and(2) a default by PDVSA on its loan from Rosneft, resulting in Rosneft coming into possession of PDVSA’s United States CITGO assets, would warrant careful consideration by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.(c) Preventing Rosneft from controlling United States energy infrastructure.—The President shall take all necessary steps to prevent Rosneft from gaining control of critical United States energy infrastructure.(d) Security risk report.—Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit a report assessing the national security risks posed by potential Russian acquisition and control of CITGO’s United States energy infrastructure holdings to—(1) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate;(2) the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate;(3) the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate;(4) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives;(5) the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives; and(6) the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives.

Sec. 202. Findings.Congress makes the following findings:(1) The security of partners and allies in the Eastern Mediterranean region is critical to the security of the United States and Europe.(2) Greece is a valuable member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and a key pillar of stability in the Eastern Mediterranean.(3) Israel is a steadfast ally of the United States and has been designated a “major non-NATO ally” and “major strategic partner”.(4) Cyprus is a key strategic partner and signed a Statement of Intent with the United States on November 6, 2018, to enhance bilateral security cooperation.(5) The countries of Greece, Cyprus, and Israel have participated in critical trilateral summits to improve cooperation on energy and security issues.(6) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo participated in the trilateral summit among Israel, Greece, and Cyprus on March 20, 2019.(7) The United States, Israel, Greece, and Cyprus oppose any action in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean Sea that could challenge stability, violate international law, or undermine good neighborly relations, and in a joint declaration on March 21, 2019, agreed to “defend against external malign influences in the Eastern Mediterranean and the broader Middle East”.(8) The recent discovery of what may be the region’s largest natural gas field off the Egyptian coast and the newest discoveries of natural gas off the coast of Cyprus could represent a significant and positive development for the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East, enhancing the region’s strategic energy significance.(9) It is in the national security interest of the United States to promote, achieve, and maintain energy security among, and through cooperation with, allies.(10) Natural gas developments in the Eastern Mediterranean have the potential to provide economic gains and contribute to energy security in the region and Europe, as well as support European efforts to diversify away from natural gas supplied by the Russian Federation.(11) The soon to be completed Trans Adriatic Pipeline is a critical component of the Southern Gas Corridor and the European Union’s efforts to diversify energy resources.(12) The proposed Eastern Mediterranean pipeline, if commercially viable, would provide for energy diversification in accordance with the European Union’s third energy package of reforms.(13) The United States acknowledges the achievements and importance of the Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation (BIRD) and the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) and supports continued multiyear funding to ensure the continuity of the programs of the Foundations.(14) The United States has welcomed Greece’s allocation of 2 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) to defense in accordance with commitments made at the 2014 NATO Summit in Wales.(15) Energy exploration in the Eastern Mediterranean region must be safeguarded against threats posed by terrorist and extremist groups, including Hezbollah and any other actor in the region.(16) The energy exploration in the Republic of Cyprus’s Exclusive Economic Zone and territorial waters—(A) furthers United States interests by providing a potential alternative to Russian gas for United States allies and partners; and(B) should not be impeded by other sovereign states.(17) The United States Government cooperates closely with Cyprus, Greece, and Israel through information sharing agreements.(18) United States officials have assisted the Government of the Republic of Cyprus with crafting that nation’s national security strategy.(19) The United States Government provides training to Cypriot officials in areas such as cybersecurity, counterterrorism, and explosive ordnance disposal and stockpile management.(20) Israel, Greece, and Cyprus are valued members of the Proliferation Security Initiative to combat the trafficking of weapons of mass destruction.(21) The Republic of Cyprus continues to work closely with the United Nations and regional partners in Europe to combat terrorism and violent extremism.(22) Despite robust economic and security relations with the United States, the Republic of Cyprus has been subject to a United States prohibition on the export of defense articles and services since 1987.(23) The 1987 arms prohibition was designed to restrict United States arms sales and transfers to the Republic of Cyprus and the occupied part of Cyprus to avoid hindering reunification efforts.(24) At least 40,000 Turkish troops are stationed in the occupied part of Cyprus with some weapons procured from the United States through mainland Turkey.(25) While the United States has, as a matter of policy, avoided the provision of defense articles and services to the Republic of Cyprus, the Government of Cyprus has, in the past, sought to obtain defense articles from other countries, including countries, such as Russia, that pose challenges to United States interests around the world.

Sec. 401. Short title.This title may be cited as the “Preventing Child Marriage in Displaced Populations Act”.
*****
Sec. 402. Findings.Congress finds the following:(1) According to United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 12,000,000 girls marry before the age of 18 every year.(2) Early marriage denies children, especially girls, their right to make vital decisions about their well-being, including relating to their health, family, and career. Child brides are less likely to finish their education, and are at higher risk for abuse, contracting HIV, and dying while pregnant or giving birth.(3) Child marriage also imposes substantial economic costs to developing countries, impeding development and prosperity gains.(4) Displaced populations are particularly vulnerable to child marriage, in communities where poverty, instability, and displacement put pressure on families to marry children, particularly young girls, off at a young age.(5) One United Nations (UN) study found that child marriage rates were 4 times higher among displaced Syrian refugees than among Syrians before the crisis. This indicates that displacement, instability, and poverty are driving child marriages.(6) United Nations agencies, including UNICEF and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), have acknowledged the dangers of child marriage and taken steps to address its risk in the populations they serve.(7) The UN Joint Program on Child Marriage supports this work by building the resilience of populations to indirectly prevent child marriage and by generating new data and evidence on the prevalence of child marriage in humanitarian and fragile settings. For example, in Uganda, the UN Joint Program on Child Marriage helped 27,000 adolescent girls strengthen critical skills through school clubs and Go Back to School campaigns, as well as life skills and financial literacy training.(8) After the UN Joint Program on Child Marriage identified Yemen as one of its focus countries, 65,000 people, of whom 45,000 are adolescents, were reached with awareness-raising activities on the harms of child marriage in 2018 alone. As a result, local council representatives, elders, and community leaders from 6 districts signed a pledge to support advocacy efforts to end child marriage.

Sec. 403. Preventing child marriage in displaced populations.(a) In general.—The President shall direct the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States at the United Nations to call for an adoption of an agreed upon definition of “child marriage” across United Nations agencies.(b) Strategy.—The President shall direct the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States at the United Nations to call for the development of a comprehensive strategy to address child marriage in refugee settlements administered by the United Nations. The strategy should include the following elements:(1) A mandate to regularly collect and report data related to the number of known or suspected child marriages taking place inside each such settlement.(2) Protocols for United Nations personnel regarding prevention and monitoring of child marriages inside each such settlement.(3) A description of United Nations programs administered at such settlements that include—(A) physical, mental, and emotional rehabilitation and support to children who have extricated themselves from child marriage; and(B) alternatives to child marriage, such as education initiatives.(4) Protocols regarding how United Nations personnel should—(A) report adults participating in illegal child marriages in each such settlement; and(B) monitor the prosecution of such adults by the authorities of the country in which the settlement at issue is located.(c) Research.—The President shall direct the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States at the United Nations to advocate for the United Nations and its appropriate agencies to include, as appropriate, in all of its research regarding child marriage, the relationship between child marriage and violence against girls, including young children and infants.(d) Definitions.—In this section:(1) Child marriage.—The term “child marriage” means a formal marriage or informal union involving at least one person younger than age 18.(2) Illegal child marriage.—The term “illegal child marriage” means a child marriage that is illegal under the laws of the country in which the child marriage occurs.

Sec. 702. Findings.Congress makes the following findings:(1) According to the 2017 National Security Strategy of the United States of America, “Retaining our position as the world’s preeminent economic actor strengthens our ability to use the tools of economic diplomacy for the good of Americans and others.”.(2) A November 7, 2018, cable from Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo to all diplomatic and consular posts—“Boosting Commercial Diplomacy Around the World”—stated that “helping American companies is a foreign policy priority…Promoting broad-based, responsible, and sustainable economic growth helps to stabilize regions and creates new and growing markets for U.S. companies. A transparent and level playing field for U.S. investment in these countries counters real and growing challenges such as China’s Belt and Road initiative.”.(3) In the January–February 2019 issue of The Foreign Service Journal, Ambassador Barbara Stephenson, the President of the American Foreign Service Association, wrote, “Foreign Service support for American business…is a major reason why the U.S. Foreign Service was created.”.

subsection:“(e) Application of qualification requirements for certain multiple employer plans with pooled plan providers.—“(1) In general.—Except as provided in paragraph (2), if a defined contribution plan to which subsection (c) applies—“(A) is maintained by employers which have a common interest other than having adopted the plan, or“(B) in the case of a plan not described in subparagraph (A), has a pooled plan provider,then the plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements under this title applicable to a plan described in section 401(a) or to a plan that consists of individual retirement accounts described in section 408 (including by reason of subsection (c) thereof), whichever is applicable, merely because one or more employers of employees covered by the plan fail to take such actions as are required of such employers for the plan to meet such requirements.“(2) Limitations.—“(A) In general.—Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any plan unless the terms of the plan provide that in the case of any employer in the plan failing to take the actions described in paragraph (1)—“(i) the assets of the plan attributable to employees of such employer (or beneficiaries of such employees) will be transferred to a plan maintained only by such employer (or its successor), to an eligible retirement plan as defined in section 402(c)(8)(B) for each individual whose account is transferred, or to any other arrangement that the Secretary determines is appropriate, unless the Secretary determines it is in the best interests of the employees of such employer (and the beneficiaries of such employees) to retain the assets in the plan, and“(ii) such employer (and not the plan with respect to which the failure occurred or any other employer in such plan) shall, except to the extent provided by the Secretary, be liable for any liabilities with respect to such plan attributable to employees of such employer (or beneficiaries of such employees).“(B) Failures by pooled plan providers.—If the pooled plan provider of a plan described in paragraph (1)(B) does not perform substantially all of the administrative duties which are required of the provider under paragraph (3)(A)(i) for any plan year, the Secretary may provide that the determination as to whether the plan meets the requirements under this title applicable to a plan described in section 401(a) or to a plan that consists of individual retirement accounts described in section 408 (including by reason of subsection (c) thereof), whichever is applicable, shall be made in the same manner as would be made without regard to paragraph (1).“(3) Pooled plan provider.—“(A) In general.—For purposes of this subsection, the term ‘pooled plan provider’ means, with respect to any plan, a person who—“(i) is designated by the terms of the plan as a named fiduciary (within the meaning of section 402(a)(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974), as the plan administrator, and as the person responsible to perform all administrative duties (including conducting proper testing with respect to the plan and the employees of each employer in the plan)

401(a) or to a plan that consists of individual retirement accounts described in section 408 (including by reason of subsection (c) thereof), whichever is applicable, and“(II) each employer in the

other information which the Secretary may require or which such person otherwise determines are necessary to administer the plan or to allow the plan to meet such requirements,“(ii) registers as a pooled plan provider with the Secretary, and provides such other information to the Secretary as the Secretary may require, before beginning operations as a pooled plan provider,“(iii) acknowledges in writing that such person is a named fiduciary (within the meaning of section 402(a)(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974), and the plan administrator, with respect to the plan, and“(iv) is responsible for ensuring that all persons who handle assets of, or who are fiduciaries of, the plan are bonded in accordance with section 412 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.“(B) Audits, examinations and investigations.—The Secretary may perform audits, examinations, and investigations of pooled plan providers as may be necessary to enforce and carry out the purposes of this subsection.“(C) Aggregation rules.—For purposes of this paragraph, in determining whether a person meets the requirements of this paragraph to be a pooled plan provider with respect to any plan, all persons who perform services for the plan and who are treated as a single employer under subsection (b), (c), (m), or (o) of section 414 shall be treated as one person.“(D) Treatment of employers as plan sponsors.—Except with respect to the administrative duties of the pooled plan provider described in subparagraph (A)(i), each employer in a plan which has a pooled plan provider shall be treated as the plan sponsor with respect to the portion of the plan attributable to employees of such employer (or beneficiaries of such employees).“(4) Guidance.—“(A) In general.—The Secretary shall issue such guidance as the Secretary determines appropriate to carry out this subsection, including guidance—“(i) to identify the administrative duties and other actions required to be performed by a pooled plan provider under this subsection,“(ii) which describes the procedures to be taken to terminate a plan which fails to meet the requirements to be a plan described in paragraph (1), including the proper treatment of, and actions needed to be taken by, any employer in the plan and the assets and liabilities of the plan attributable to employees of such employer (or beneficiaries of such employees), and“(iii) identifying appropriate cases to which the rules of paragraph (2)(A) will apply to employers in the plan failing to take the actions described in paragraph (1).The Secretary shall take into account under clause (iii) whether the failure of an employer or pooled plan provider to provide any disclosures or other information, or to take any other action, necessary to administer a plan or to allow a plan to meet requirements applicable to the plan under section 401(a) or 408, whichever is applicable, has continued over a period of time that demonstrates a lack of commitment to compliance.“(B) Good faith compliance with law before guidance.—An employer or pooled plan provider shall not be treated as failing to meet a requirement of guidance issued by the Secretary under this paragraph if, before the issuance of such guidance, the employer or pooled plan provider complies in good faith with a reasonable interpretation of the provisions of this subsection to which such guidance relates.“(5) Model plan.—The Secretary shall publish model plan language which meets the requirements of this subsection and of paragraphs (43) and

period, solely as a result of such amendments.“(E) Determination of substantial increase for aggregate testing on benefits basis.—In applying subparagraph (C)(ii) for purposes of subparagraph

benefits, rights, or features provided to such closed class if the defined contribution plan and defined benefit plan otherwise meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) but for the fact that the make-whole contributions under the defined contribution plan are made in whole or in part through matching contributions.“(D) Spun-off plans.—For purposes of this paragraph, if a portion of a defined contribution plan described in subparagraph (A) or (C) is spun off to another employer, the treatment under subparagraph (A) or (C) of the spun-off plan shall continue with respect to the other employer if such plan continues to comply with the requirements of clauses (ii) (if the original plan was still within the 3-year period described in such clause at the time of the spin off) and (iii)
