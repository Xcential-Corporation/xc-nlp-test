Sec. 2. Sense of Congress; purpose.(a) Sense of Congress.—It is the sense of Congress that—(1) an infectious disease pandemic known as COVID–19 exists;(2) to date, there is much still unknown about COVID–19, but it is known that COVID–19 and related complications may be fatal; (3) services provided by public safety officers are nonetheless essential during this pandemic;(4) due to the COVID–19 pandemic and what is currently known about how the disease is spread, public safety officers are uncharacteristically at risk of contracting the disease; and(5) although the Public Safety Officers' Benefits program currently covers deaths and permanent and total disabilities resulting from infectious disease sustained by public safety officers in carrying out their duties, the determination of claims involving personal injuries believed to have resulted from COVID–19 or its complications may be uniquely challenging or delayed given the lack of—(A) definitive testing and medical records at this time; and(B) a definitive uniform body of medical information about how the disease is spread or its effects. (b) Purpose.—The purpose of this Act is to establish a carefully drawn framework wherein claims under the Public Safety Officers' Benefits program, arising under the unique circumstances described in subsection (a), can be processed expeditiously and under fair and clear standards.
