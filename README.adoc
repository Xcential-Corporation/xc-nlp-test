2. Created pandas_dataframe for storing bill document and sections data with their ID and Text
3. Save Vocabulary Corpus of Bill Documents and Section to Parquet File
4. Train Count Vectorizer for Bill Documents and Sections using Pandas Dataframe
5. Store Train Count Vectorizer for Bill Documents and Sections using Pandas Dataframe
6. Created vectorized dataframe for Bill Documents and Sections from trained model
7. Stored vectorized dataframe for Bill Documents and Sections into Parquet File
8. Loads the dataframe to memory
9. Calculates the similarity score for a batch of documents by multiplying the panda dataframe for that batch vs. the dataframe for the full data set.
10. Enter any Bill ID to find similarity using matrix multiplication of [bill1]*[ALL BILLS] to calculate all similiarities at once.
11. Filters the results by two thresholds: a) threshold for whole bill and b) threshold for sections.
