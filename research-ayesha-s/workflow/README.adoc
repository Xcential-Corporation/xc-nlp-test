# Workflow for training models and calculating pairwise similarity

Training Models Setup Notebooks:

1. Document and Section Similarity Score Predictor using Hash Vectorizer - Training Setup
2. Document and Section Similarity Score Predictor using Count Vectorizer - Training Setup
3. Document and Section Similarity Score Predictor using Tfidf Vectorizer - Training Setup

First 3 notebooks are for Training setup. Like when you need to setup the project for the first time for all three vectorization techniques. In the Training setup, model will be trained first time over the documents.


Re-Training Models with new Documents Notebooks:

1. Document and Section Similarity Score Predictor using Hash Vectorizer - Re Training with new Documents
2. Document and Section Similarity Score Predictor using Count Vectorizer - Re Training with new Documents
3. Document and Section Similarity Score Predictor using Tfidf Vectorizer - Re Training with new Documents
These 3 notebooks are for re-Training the models on the new documents along with previous corpus. In these notebooks we will use the store data corpuses and models from the local disk and then will do retraining of models.

Document and Section Similarity Score Prediction with Json response:

1. Document and Section Similarity Score Predictor using Hash Vectorizer - Calculating Time of Cosine Similarity and Json response
2. Document and Section Similarity Score Predictor using Count Vectorizer - Calculating Time of Cosine Similarity and Json response
3. Document and Section Similarity Score Predictor using Tfidf Vectorizer - Calculating Time of Cosine Similarity and Json response

These 3 notebooks are for computing the cosine similarity score of given two documents for all three vectorization techniques. The resulted response is creating in Json format.

Document and Section Similarity Score Prediction with List response:

1. Document and Section Similarity Score Predictor using Hash Vectorizer - Calculating Time of Cosine Similarity and Array List response
2. Document and Section Similarity Score Predictor using Count Vectorizer - Calculating Time of Cosine Similarity and Array List response
3. Document and Section Similarity Score Predictor using Tfidf Vectorizer - Calculating Time of Cosine Similarity and Array List response

These 3 notebooks are for computing the cosine similarity score of given two documents for all three vectorization techniques. The resulted response is creating in List format and the time taken is reduced drastically.

Note: There could be slight time difference when you run the notebooks on your machine. Potential reasons are:

1. System/Server Configuration
2. Multiple/heavy Tasks running in the background. That has huge impact. It can slow down the performance for running the current task thus increasing the time. For a dedicated server to run this task, performance will be further optimized.

Changes and Updates:

1. New feature are also introduced here to store the data corpuses in the training setup to re-load later for an automated project pipeline. This is the awesome feature for automated pipeline, web api publishing, model re-training etc.
2. New list response is introduced for creating the response to light weight the response size and reducing time so that if you want to extend this application in future for any web app or tool you can do it easily and very efficiently in short time even for large file sizes.
